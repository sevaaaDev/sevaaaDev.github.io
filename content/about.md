# About me
My name is Sevan, im a programmer from indonesia. Im interested in backend and system programming. I also like making programming tool like a neovim plugin, cli tool and stuff like that.

Although I mostly write backend code, I also like little bit of web design. I made this website by myself without using any pre-made theme or css library.

## Outside programming
Computer stuff forces me to sit all day, so I do calisthenics, and try to move everyday. 

I like science fiction and science in general. The books that I have are mostly science book and sci-fi novel.

## About this website
I dont have the typical social media account (instagram, reddit, x, y, z) so this website is supposed to be my "social media". I actually dont know what I will do in this website other than publishing small blog.
