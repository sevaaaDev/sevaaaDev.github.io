<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I'm a programmer from Indonesia. I started learning how to program because i
  wanted to fix a bug in an open source app i used. I'm fascinated by open
  source culture and love the idea of making tools that help people.
</p>
<p>Right now, i mostly do low level programming and backend</p>
