<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I'm a programmer from Indonesia. I started learning how to program because i
  want to fix a bug in an open source app. I'm fascinated with open source
  culture and love the idea of making tools that helps people.
</p>
<p>other than that, i also like linux, terminal and minimalism</p>
