Notice that big <kbd>space</kbd> bar on your keyboard? you know that your thumbs dont get used for anything other than pressing space character. Now, you can make your thumbs useful by remapping the <kbd>space</kbd> bar.

## Remapping keys

You can remap <kbd>space</kbd> as <kbd>ctrl</kbd> when hold. This way you can use your thumb for ctrl key combination. For typical keyboard, both of your thumb rest on the space key, therefore you can use both thumb to do that.

## Problem

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>space</kbd> combination is not possible unless you use the original <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key.

One solution is to use tap-dance. tap-dance is a feature in Kanata (it is a key remapper software) for maping a **sequence of key press**, this mean you can make lets say <kbd>space</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> to output <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>space</kbd> **only** if you press that sequence quickly.

You can also try keychord. Another feature in Kanata where you press 2 or more keys at once to produce another output.

Those solution can be done with common remapping software other than Kanata.
