I've been using Linux for about a year now. My journey started in Ubuntu 24.04, though I had experimented with other distros before that, Ubuntu was the one i used seriously for months — until I distro-hopped again, this time to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)


The window manager i currently use is [river](https://codeberg.org/river). I've used many window managers; the one i stuck with for quite a long time was [dwl](https://codeberg.org/dwl). i did like the minimalism of it, but patching is a pain, so now I've switched to river because it just works


[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/waybar) is the status bar i use; it uses CSS for styling, which makes it better than other status bars. Yes, i know its bloated, but its pretty and just works


My go-to text editor is [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim); i use it because real devs use it.


Terminal emulator: [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty) — pretty minimal for my taste, and it supports wayland
